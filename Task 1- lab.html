      <p>Hi, I'm Amgad Nady, a Flutter developer with a Bachelor's degree in
        Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I'm passionate about
        building clean, scalable, and responsive mobile apps using Dart and
        Flutter. I've worked on internship projects like Splitwise Clone and Du
        Predict, and Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in augmented reality and
